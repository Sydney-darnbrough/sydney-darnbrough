        <p>"A major theme that runs throughout Steyerl’s essay is that of surveillance. In your own words, define surveillance and discuss how the notion of a “vertical” or aerial perspective lends itself to a culture of surveillance according to Steyerl’s thought experiment."</p>
        <br>
        <p>Surveillances is a vast term which in this context is used to describe the tools and technology available to allow us to see certain objects/landmarks/views in new and intriguing perspectives that may have been seen previously as unrealistic perspectives. Survaliances is in reference to things such as security cameras that provide a perspective of seemingly another observer simply levitating safely away from whatever is happening below. Surveillance technology strays from the traditional viewpoint of a vertical horizon and instead offers a birds eye view perspective.  The ability to see things from this new perspective that is only available or accessible via machines is typically from a perspective that may give viewers this feeling of falling. This happens when the perspective point or the horizon line get messed with. When the horizon is no longer in view this is when people often feel like they are falling. Such as when looking up at really tall buildings or looking down off of a tall platform for example down a staircase.</p>
